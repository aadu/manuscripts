  abstract = {The number of studies using tryptophan depletion (TD) challenge has
	increased markedly in the past few years. Recently, a number of negative
	results have been published, implicating that the effect of TD on
	mood may be less consistent than previously thought.The literature
	on the mood effects of TD in psychiatric patients and healthy volunteers
	was reviewed.TD has a mood-lowering effect in subgroups of recovered
	depressed patients, patients with seasonal affective disorder and
	vulnerable healthy subjects. The mood effect in former patients is
	of a different quality, however, than the effect in healthy subjects.
	Some recent negative studies in depression might be explained by
	insufficient lowering of plasma tryptophan levels. Preliminary evidence
	exists for an effect of TD on bulimia nervosa, autism, aggression
	and substance dependence.The effects of TD on mood may be more consistent
	than suggested by a number of recent negative studies. Response to
	TD in recovered depressed patients is associated with prior treatment.
	However, even in SSRI-treated patients the relapse rates are not
	higher than 50-60\%, which needs to be explained. The clinical usefulness
	of the response to TD in recovered patients (prediction of relapse
	after treatment discontinuation) and in symptomatic patients (prediction
	of treatment refractoriness) deserves more research attention. Further
	suggestions for future research include the cognitive effects of
	TD in recovered depressed patients and the effect of dietary habits
	on response to TD.},

  abstract = {Dopamine (DA) and serotonin have been implicated in the regulation
	of aggressive behavior, but it has remained challenging to assess
	the dynamic changes in these neurotransmitters while aggressive behavior
	is in progress. The objective of this study was to learn about ongoing
	monoamine activity in corticolimbic areas during aggressive confrontations
	in rats. Male Long-Evans rats were implanted with a microdialysis
	probe aimed at the nucleus accumbens (NAC) or medial prefrontal cortex
	(PFC); next, 10 min samples were collected before, during, and after
	a 10 min confrontation. Rats continued to display aggressive behavior
	while being sampled, and they performed two to six attack bites as
	well as 140 sec of aggressive acts and postures. Dopamine levels
	in NAC were significantly increased up to 60 min after the confrontation.
	Peak levels of 140\% were achieved approximately 20-30 min after
	the confrontation. No concurrent changes in accumbal serotonin levels
	were seen during or after the confrontation. Dopamine and serotonin
	levels in PFC changed in the opposite direction, with a sustained
	decrease in serotonin to 80\% of baseline levels during and after
	the confrontation and an increase in dopamine to 120\% after the
	confrontation. The temporal pattern of monoamine changes, which followed
	rather than preceded the confrontation, points to a significant role
	of accumbal and cortical DA and 5-hydroxytryptamine in the consequences
	as opposed to the triggering of aggressive acts. The increase in
	accumbal DA in aggressive animals supports the hypothesis that this
	neural system is linked to the execution of biologically salient
	and demanding behavior.},

  abstract = {In humans and other primates low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels
	of the major serotonin (5-HT) metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid
	(5-HIAA) have been correlated to high aggressiveness. This finding
	forms the basis of the 5-HT deficiency hypothesis of aggression.
	Surprisingly, this correlation has not been confirmed in rodents
	so far, while manipulation studies aimed to investigate the link
	between 5-HT and aggressive behaviour are mostly carried out in rodents.
	In this study the relation between aggression and CSF monoamine and
	metabolite concentrations was investigated in male Wildtype Groningen
	rats. In sharp contrast to the hypothesis and our expectation, a
	clear positive correlation was found between the individual level
	of trait-like aggressiveness and CSF concentrations of 5-HT, 5-HIAA,
	norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DA), and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic
	acid (DOPAC). Shortly after the acute display of aggressive behaviour
	(as a state-like phenomenon), decreased 5-HT levels and an increase
	in 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio and NE concentrations were found. Surprisingly,
	pharmacological challenges known to influence 5-HT transmission and
	aggressive behaviour did not affect CSF 5-HT and 5-HIAA concentrations,
	only the NE level was increased. Lesioning 5-HT terminals by 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine
	(5,7-DHT) administration caused a decrease in CSF 5-HT and 5-HIAA,
	but without affecting aggressive behaviour. The observed positive
	correlation between CSF 5-HIAA and trait aggressiveness makes it
	questionable whether a direct extrapolation of neurobiological mechanisms
	of aggression between species is justified. Interpretation of CSF
	metabolite levels in terms of activity of neural substrates requires
	a far more detailed knowledge of the dynamics and kinetics of a neurotransmitter
	after its release.},

	Variation in personality is predictive of many outcomes in life,

	association (GWA) data for personality in 10 discovery samples (17 375
	adults) and five in silico replication samples (3294 adults). All
	participants were of European ancestry. Personality scores for Neuroticism,

	were based on the NEO Five-Factor Inventory. Genotype data of ∼2.4M
	single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; directly typed and imputed

	association analyses were performed under an additive model followed
	by meta-analysis using the weighted inverse variance method. Results
	showed genome-wide significance for Openness to Experience near the
	RASA1 gene on 5q14.3 (rs1477268 and rs2032794, P=2.8 × 10(-8) and

	In silico replication did not, however, show significant associations
	of the top SNPs with Openness and Conscientiousness, although the
	direction of effect of the KATNAL2 SNP on Conscientiousness was consistent
	in all replication samples. Larger scale GWA studies and alternative

	cortisol concentrations of subordinates to those of dominants in
	stable dominance hierarchies and expressing the ratio as a percentage

	is a concentration gradient for both metabolites), and selection
	of control subjects. Once these methodological details are controlled

	evidenced by over 20 studies. The association is not confined to
	depressive illness but has also been found in schizophrenia, personality
	disorder, and certain impulse control disorders (but, interestingly,

	data. One of the problems confronting aggression researchers is the
	extensive body of multidisciplinary data that is difficult to synthesize
	to generate new directions in research. This paper proposes one solution
	that starts by asking "what is the minimal number of categories of
	concepts and measurements which are necessary to describe a person?".
	The answer is four categories of concepts: biological; cognitive;
	behavioral; environmental (physical and social). One way of many
	for integrating these four categories of concepts is a proposed discipline
	neutral heuristic model that is used herein to compare two different
	research approaches to the study of impulsive aggression. This comparison
	identifies clearly the differences in the two approaches with regard
	to different emphases among the four categories of constructs for
	each program. Using the model an example of common ground between
	the two approaches is sought as a basis for extending aggression
	research. The main conclusion of one of the research programs was
	that central nervous arousal is related to impulsive aggression.
	This program demonstrated that phenytoin will reduce impulsive aggressive
	acts and has an effect on CNS arousal. The other research program
	on impulsive aggression has been at the forefront in demonstrating
	the well established inverse relationship between serotonin levels
	and aggression. The comparison resulted in the suggestion that both
	serotonin and phenytoin may relate to a common neurochemical substrate
	which interacts in part to control CNS arousal, especially at the
	cortical level. The proposed heuristic model made obvious the need
	to use synthesizing concepts (e.g. information processing or language)
	which can interrelate multidisciplinary concepts and data from different
	research programs within the four categories of constructs when comparing
	interdisciplinary research.},

	The well-known fact that certain 5-HT(1A/1B) receptor agonists potently

	the assumption that the agonist mainly acts on the postsynaptic 5-HT(1A/1B)

	partial agonist) at postsynaptic 5-HT(1A) receptors, allows for a
	pharmacological analysis of the exact site of action of this anti-aggressive
	effect. It was found that, similar to other prototypical full and
	partial 5-HT(1A) and/or 5-HT(1B) receptor agonists like repinotan,
	8-OHDPAT, ipsapirone, buspirone, alnespirone, eltoprazine, CGS-12066B
	and CP-93129, also S-15535 very effectively reduced offensive aggressive
	behavior. Unlike the other ligands, however, a remarkable degree
	of behavioral specificity was observed after treatment with S-15535,
	in that the anti-aggressive effects were not accompanied by inhibiting
	(like other 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist with moderate to high efficacy
	at postsynaptic 5-HT(1A) receptors) or enhancing (like agonists with
	activity at 5-HT(1B) receptors and alnespirone) non-aggressive motor
	behaviors (e.g., social exploration, ambulation, rearing, and grooming)
	beyond the range of undrugged animals with corresponding levels of
	aggression. The involvement of 5-HT(1A) and/or 5-HT(1B) receptors
	in the anti-aggressive actions of these drugs was convincingly confirmed
	by showing that the selective 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist WAY-100635
	and/or the 5-HT(1B) receptor antagonist GR-127935, while inactive
	when given alone, effectively attenuated/prevented these actions.
	Furthermore, combined administration of S-15535 with either alnespirone
	or CGS-42066B elicited a clear additive effect, indicated by a left-ward
	shift in their dose-effect curves, providing further support for
	presynaptic sites of action (i.e., inhibitory somatodendritic 5-HT(1A)
	and terminal 5-HT(1B) autoreceptors). These findings strongly suggest
	that the specific anti-aggressive effects of 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(1B)
	receptor agonists are predominantly based on reduction rather than
	enhancement of 5-HT neurotransmission during the combative social
	interaction. Apparently, normal display of offensive aggressive behavior
	is positively related to brief spikes in serotonergic activity, whereas
	an inverse relationship probably exists between tonic 5-HT activity
	and abnormal forms of aggression only.},

	Overall, 5-HT(3A) receptors were widely and heterogeneously distributed
	across the neuraxis of the Syrian hamster brain. Notably, the most
	intense 5-HT(3A) immunolabeling patterns were observed in the cerebral
	cortex and amygdala. In addition, high variability in receptor density

	indicating that the role this receptor has in the modulation of a
	particular neural function differs depending on brain region. In
	some regions (i.e., nucleus accumbens) differences in the immunolabeling

	Twenty-four with high trait aggression (H) and 24 with low (L) drank
	an amino acid mixture with (T+) or without (T-) tryptophan. These
	caused plasma tryptophan enhancement and depletion, respectively,
	at 4.5 h. Group H subjects given T- became more angry, aggressive,
	annoyed, hostile and quarrelsome on subjective measures, whereas
	those given T+ responded in the opposite way. On a behavioural measure

	T- than T+. In contrast, there was no consistent effect on subjective

	T+ reduced feelings of well-being, possibly due to the sedative effect
	of tryptophan in this group, which correlated positively with plasma
	tryptophan concentration. Changes in plasma tryptophan are probably
	followed by changes in central 5-HT turnover. We conclude that, in
	those with pre-existing aggressive traits, acute falls in central
	5-HT can cause increased subjective and objective aggression, while
	rises can have the opposite effect. The absence of changes in a low
	aggressive group suggests that the primary effect may be on impulsivity,

	traits. The findings on mood changes provide support for earlier

	regulation of impulsive aggressive behavior. This study was performed
	to use a highly selective agent for 5-HT (d-Fenfluramine, d-FEN)
	in a large group of human subjects to further explore this relationship
	dimensionally and categorically. One hundred and fifty healthy subjects
	(100 with personality disorder, PD and 50 healthy volunteer controls,
	HV) underwent d-FEN challenge studies. Residual peak delta prolactin
	(DeltaPRL[d-FEN]-R; ie, after the removal of potentially confounding
	variables) was used as the primary 5-HT response variable. Composite
	measures of aggression and impulsivity were used as dimensional measures,
	and history of suicidal/self-injurious behavior as well as the presence
	of intermittent explosive disorder (IED) were used as categorical
	variables. DeltaPRL[d-FEN]-R responses correlated inversely with
	composite aggression, but not composite impulsivity, in all subjects
	and in males and females examined separately. The correlation with
	composite aggression was strongest in male PD subjects. DeltaPRL[d-FEN]-R
	values were reduced in PD subjects with a history of suicidal behavior
	but not, self-injurious behavior. DeltaPRL[d-FEN]-R values were also
	reduced in patients meeting Research Criteria for IED. Physiologic
	responses to 5-HT stimulation are reduced as a function of aggression
	(but not generalized impulsivity) in human subjects. The same is
	true for personality disordered subjects with a history of suicidal,
	but not self-injurious, behavior and for subjects with a diagnosis
	of IED by research criteria. These data have particular relevance
	to the notion of impulsive aggression and the biological validity

	subtype, though further studies are needed to confirm this effect.
	It is uncertain whether the PRL responses to other 'presynaptic'
	challenges of 5-HT function, for example, fenfluramine, are mediated
	by the same post-synaptic 5-HT receptor subtype as that for LTP.
	Conversely it seems likely that agonists which stimulate 5-HT2/1C
	receptors increase both plasma PRL and ACTH in humans. There is also
	evidence that 5-HT1A receptors can increase ACTH secretion. This
	suggests that in humans as in animals both the 5-HT1A and 5HT2/1C
	receptors can facilitate ACTH release, though the significance of
	this dual control is not understood. It is also possible that both
	5-HT1A and 5-HT2/1C receptors stimulate PRL release, but 5-HT1A receptors
	may have a more prominent role in GH secretion. In both human and
	animal studies 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 receptor agonists may produce opposite
	effects on body temperature. These recent developments in 5-HT neuroendocrinology
	have been of great interest, but much is still uncertain. Progress

  abstract = {Suicidality is a major challenge for today's health care. Evidence
	suggests that there are differences in cognitive functioning of suicidal
	patients but the knowledge about the underlying neurobiology is limited.
	Brain imaging offers the advantage of a non-invasive in vivo direct
	estimation of detailed brain structure, regional brain functioning
	and estimation of molecular processes in the brain. We have reviewed
	the literature on neuroimaging studies of the suicidal brain. This
	article contains studies on structural imaging such as Computed Tomography
	(CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and functional imaging,
	consisting of Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Single Photon Emission
	Tomography (SPECT) and functional MRI (fMRI). We classified the results
	of the different imaging modalities in structural and functional
	imaging. Within our research, we found no significant differences
	in the suicidal brain demonstrated by Computed Tomography. Magnetic
	Resonance Imaging studies in subjects with a history of suicide attempt
	on the other hand deliver differing results, mostly pointing at a
	higher prevalence of white (especially deep white matter and periventricular)
	and grey matter hyperintensities in the frontal, temporal and/or
	parietal lobe and decreased volumes in the frontal and temporal lobe.
	There seems to be a trend towards findings of reduced grey matter
	volume in the frontal lobe. Overall, there is no consensus of opinion
	on structural imaging of the suicidal brain. Research on functional
	imaging is further divided into studies in resting state, studies
	in activation conditions and studies on brain neurotransmitters,
	transporters and receptors. A common finding in functional neuroimaging
	in resting conditions is a decreased perfusion in the prefrontal
	cortex of suicidal patients. During cognitive activation, perfusion
	deficits in the prefrontal cortex have been observed. After fenfluramine
	challenge, the prefrontal cortex metabolism seems to be inversely
	correlated to the lethality of previous suicide attempt. The few
	studies that examined the serotonin transporter in suicide found
	no significant differences in binding potential. In suicide attempters
	there seems to be a negative correlation between impulsivity and
	SERT binding. Our group found a reduced 5-HT(2A) binding in the frontal
	cortex in patients with a recent suicide attempt. The binding index
	was significantly lower in the deliberate self injury patients compared
	to the deliberate self poisoning patients. The few authors that examined
	DAT binding in suicide found no significant DAT differences between
	patients and controls. However they demonstrated significant negative
	correlations between DAT binding potential and mental energy among
	suicide attempters, but not in healthy control subjects. We did not
	find studies measuring the binding potential of the noradrenalin
	or gamma amino butyric acid transporter or receptor in suicidal subjects.
	Several reports have suggested abnormalities of GABA neurotransmission
	in depression. During our literature search, we have focused on neuroimaging
	studies in suicidal populations, but in the absence of evidence in
	the literature on this group or when further collateral evidence
	is appropriate, this overview expands to results in impulsive aggressive
	or in depressed subjects.},

	Childhood abuse is an important predictor of ASPD. We examined 5-HTTLPR

	5-HT3 receptors are potentiated by ethanol and appear to modulate

	of early-onset alcoholics with co-morbid ASPD. Low-voltage alpha
	electroencephalogram (EEG) power, a highly heritable trait, has been
	associated with both AUD and ASPD. A recent whole genome linkage

	a suggestive linkage peak for alpha power at the 5-HT3R locus. We
	tested whether genetic variation within the HTR3A and HTR3B genes
	influences vulnerability to AUD with comorbid ASPD (AUD+ASPD) and
	moderates alpha power. Our study included three samples: 284 criminal
	alcoholic Finnish Caucasians and 234 controls; two independent community-ascertained
	samples with resting EEG recordings: a predominantly Caucasian sample
	of 191 individuals (Bethesda) and 306 PI. In the Finns, an intronic
	HTR3B SNP rs3782025 was associated with AUD+ASPD (P=.004). In the
	Bethesda sample, the same allele predicted lower alpha power (P=7.37e(-5)).
	Associations between alpha power and two other HTR3B SNPs were also
	observed among PI (P=.03). One haplotype in the haplotype block at
	the 3' region of the gene that included rs3782025 was associated

	the Bethesda population (P=.00009). Another haplotype in this block
	was associated with alpha power among PI (P=.03). No associations
	were found for HTR3A. Genetic variation within HTR3B may influence
	vulnerability to develop AUD with comorbid ASPD. 5-HT3R might contribute

	in the environment or task conditions. Previous research suggested
	that serotonin (5-HT) is involved in cognitive flexibility. Disturbed
	5-HT functioning in animals, psychiatric patients and healthy volunteers
	leads to more rigid behavior. A well recognized method to manipulate
	levels of brain 5-HT is acute tryptophan depletion (ATD). This method
	induces a transient and reversible lowering of plasma tryptophan
	that has been shown to result in decreased brain 5-HT. Only recently
	has ATD research been combined with functional Magnetic Resonance
	Imaging (fMRI). In this review, we discuss recent investigations
	into the effect of ATD on the Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD)
	response during tasks that require cognitive flexibility, in healthy
	volunteers. Functional MRI studies have shown that ATD changes brain
	activation during tasks that require cognitive flexibility. It is
	hypothesized that ATD changes the processing of negative feedback,
	rather than impairing response inhibition, impairing the response
	to an error or the loss of cognitive control during response interference.
	Although the results of these studies are intriguing, they are sometimes
	contradictory. This could be the result of the different paradigms
	that have been used. Importantly, these studies strongly suggest
	that future multidisciplinary research should evaluate the mechanisms
	underlying individual differences and control for variables that
	have been shown to interact with the effect of ATD on cognitive flexibility
	and the related brain activation.},

	life events (ETLE) experienced during the first 15 years of life
	and the display of physical aggression during adulthood, as assessed
	by the Aggression Questionnaire. An ANOVA model including gender,
	exposure to early trauma, and MAOA genotype as between-subjects factors
	showed significant MAOAxETLE (F(1,227) = 8.20, P = 0.005) and genderxMAOAxETLE
	(F(1,227) = 7.04, P = 0.009) interaction effects. Physical aggression
	scores were higher in men who had experienced early traumatic life
	events and who carried the low MAOA activity allele (MAOA-L). We
	repeated the analysis in the subgroup of healthy volunteers (N =
	145) to exclude that the observed GxE interactions were due to the
	inclusion of psychiatric patients in our sample and were not generalizable

	effects involving the MAOA polymorphism was 6.6\% in the entire sample

	the hypothesis that, when combined with exposure to early traumatic
	life events, low MAOA activity is a significant risk factor for aggressive
	behavior during adulthood and suggest that the use of dimensional

	reuptake and 5-HT1A receptors have been well characterized, but the
	contribution of other serotonin receptor subtypes is not as clear.
	1-(3-Chlorophenyl)-piperazine (mCPP), which binds non-selectively
	to a wide range of serotonin receptors, has often been used to produce
	anxiety in humans and in animal models. Because functional assays
	indicate that mCPP is significantly more potent at 5-HT2C receptors,
	it may serve as a tool to investigate the contribution of 5-HT2C
	receptors to anxiety. This paper reviews the results of behavioral
	tests using mCPP, including the drug discrimination assay, to model
	anxiety. Although the discriminative stimulus effects of mCPP do
	not seem to be a useful screen for general anxiolytics, they do seem
	to be useful for characterization of the contribution of 5-HT1B and
	5-HT2C receptors to the mediation of anxiety-like behaviors.},

	(mCPP) showed conflicting results, with some authors concluding that
	the cue was mediated by 5-HT2C receptors, but others that it was
	definitively not. We further examined the discriminative stimulus
	properties of mCPP in rats and reviewed previously published data.
	We trained rats to discriminate mCPP (2.0 mg/kg, PO) from water.
	We found that the mCPP cue generalized to m-trifluoromethyl-phenylpiperazine
	(TFMPP) and 6-chloro-2-(1-piperazinyl)-pyrazine (MK-212), and partially
	to eltoprazine, 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI),
	fenfluramine and trazodone. A moderate level of generalization was
	obtained with quipazine, 1-(m-chlorophenyl)biguanide and clonidine.
	No generalization was found with flesinoxan, methiothepin, idazoxan
	and haloperidol. Mianserin and methysergide antagonized the mCPP
	stimulus, whereas ketanserin antagonized it partially. Metergoline,
	methiothepin and clozapine only marginally antagonized the mCPP stimulus.
	These results show that the discriminative stimulus effects of mCPP
	are predominantly mediated by 5-HT2C receptors, and to some extent
	by 5-HT1B receptors. When considering our results and other research
	together, the substitution tests clearly point to a 5-HT2C receptor
	mediated stimulus, with an additional role for 5-HT1B receptors.
	Antagonism studies are less clearcut, but are also suggestive of
	a 5-HT2C receptor mediated effect. A definitive answer as to whether
	other receptors, e.g. 5-HT2B and 5-HT7, are of any importance in
	mCPP's discriminative stimulus properties has to wait for more selective

	(5-HTT) function would not have been maintained throughout evolution

	function. Here, we review recent findings that humans and nonhuman
	primates carrying the s variant of the 5-HTTLPR outperform subjects
	carrying the long allele in an array of cognitive tasks and show
	increased social conformity. In addition, studies in 5-HTT knockout

	mediated by hyperactivity in corticolimbic structures, may be the
	common denominator in the anxiety-related traits and (social) cognitive
	superiority of s-allele carriers and that environmental conditions
	determine whether a response will turn out to be negative (emotional)
	or positive (cognitive, in conformity with the social group). Taken

	deficit-oriented connotation of the 5-HTTLPR variants. In fact, these
	factors may counterbalance or completely offset the negative consequences
	of the anxiety-related traits. This notion may not only explain the

	recovery from depression. Based upon evidence that the 5-HT and NE
	systems were associated with different emotions, it was hypothesized
	that changes in these systems were associated with different components
	of behavior in drug-responsive patients and not with changes in the
	"whole" disorder. Findings from this multihospital study of 104 unipolar
	and bipolar depressed patients showed early drug-associated reductions
	in anxiety and hostility in treatment responders to precede changes
	in motor retardation and depressed mood. Adopting this approach of
	looking for relationships between changes in components of major
	depression and changes in neurotransmitter system function, decreases
	in 5-HT and NE metabolite concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
	in patients treated with tricyclics, were found to be correlated
	with changes in specific behaviors. Results indicated the following:
	(1) drug-induced changes in the 5-HT system to be associated with
	mood aspects, notably anxiety, and depressed mood; changes in NE
	primarily with the psychomotor, secondarily with the mood components
	of the depressed state; (2) the pattern of relationships between
	changes in 5-HT and in mood in the unipolar was different than that
	in the bipolar subtype. The results indicate that in determining
	the relationships of biochemical changes to behavioral ones, that
	it is important to take into account the type of depression (bipolar
	or unipolar), as well as examining individually and over time those
	components that make up the disorder of depression. These results
	support evidence that tricyclics have multiple behavioral actions,
	that response is mediated through changes in specific behaviors and
	that this approach warrants further application in prospective studies

	Low (bLR) Responder rats that exhibit differences in emotionality
	and behavioral control, with bHRs exhibiting heightened novelty-induced
	exploration, impulsivity, and increased sensitivity to drugs of abuse,

	these changes are accompanied by alterations in the expression of
	key genes that regulate 5-HTergic neurotransmission (Tph2 and Sert)

	nucleotide tandem repeat, MAOA-uVNTR) may moderate the degree of
	risk conferred by early trauma. Experiential factors may mitigate
	or exacerbate the effects of trauma on individuals at genetic risk.
	We examined the association among MAOA-uVNTR genotype, early stress
	(family death, family separation, parents' divorce, physical and/or
	sexual abuse), quality of parental care, and disadvantageous outcomes
	(trait impulsivity/aggression and depression severity) in adult women.Diagnostic
	assessments were completed for 159 female participants. All were
	either healthy or were diagnosed with major depressive disorder or
	bipolar disorder. Participants were assessed for lifetime trait aggression
	and impulsiveness and current severity of depression, and were genotyped
	for the MAOA-uVNTR polymorphism. Participants rated the level of
	parental care they experienced, and were asked to report specific
	childhood stressors and abuse.High perceived parental care mitigated
	the effect of a childhood stressor on impulsivity scores in low-expressing
	MAOA-uVNTR allele carriers, but level of perceived care had no effect
	in the group homozygous for the high-expressing MAOA-uVNTR allele.
	Gene-environment interactions did not influence depression severity
	in the mood disorder group, indicating that the effects of parenting
	we observed in our participants were independent of depression status.These

	alcoholics. It also examined the relationship between ethanollike
	discriminative properties and the induction of craving in these patients.
	Both MCPP and yohimbine are anxiogenic in humans; thus, this study
	evaluated the role of anxiogenic and ethanollike effects in the elicitation
	of craving.Twenty-two male inpatients who met DSM-III-R criteria
	for alcohol dependence and who had not consumed alcohol for 12 to
	26 days prior to the study completed 3 days of testing that involved
	the intravenous infusion of MCPP (0.1 mg/kg), (0.1 mg/kg), yohimbine
	hydrochloride (0.4 mg/kg), or a saline solution over 2 weeks under
	double-blind conditions. Ethanollike subjective effects were assessed
	using the Sensation Scale and visual analog scales to measure the
	degree of similarity to the effects of ethanol, cocaine, and marijuana.
	Five components of craving for alcohol were assessed using visual
	analog scales. The effects of the drugs on mood were assessed using
	visual analog scales. Plasma levels of cortisol, prolactin, and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethyleneglycol
	were also measured during the test days.m-Chlorophenylpiperazine
	and yohimbine produced significant increases compared with placebo
	in Sensation Scale scores and the visual analog scale score for nervousness.
	However, the effects of MCPP were rated as more similar to those
	of ethanol, cocaine, and marijuana than were those of either yohimbine
	or placebo. Also, MCPP but not yohimbine or placebo significantly
	increased craving for alcohol. Yohimbine and MCPP increased plasma
	prolactin and cortisol levels relative to placebo, whereas only yohimbine
	increased plasma 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethleneglycol levels.m-Chlorophenylpiperazine
	produced ethanollike effects and alcohol craving in recently detoxified
	alcoholics. Yohimbine increased Sensation Scale scores but was not
	recognized as ethanollike by patients. Although both drugs produced
	comparable levels of nervousness, yohimbine did not increase craving
	for alcohol. These data further implicate serotonergic systems in
	the discriminative properties of ethanol and may indicate a serotonergic
	contribution to craving. Noradrenergic systems contributed to the
	discriminative properties of ethanol but not to those features of
	ethanol response that were salient to craving in this population.},

	serotonergic functions are said to be associated with suicidality
	and depression, but this association has not been supported by consistent
	findings.This review based on selected, often quoted publications
	in this area focuses firstly, on obviously contradictory findings
	and, secondly, on potential methodological flaws explaining these
	discrepancies.The platelet 5-HT transporter has been found to have
	an inconsistent association with suicidality; furthermore, the specificity
	of imipramine for the 5-HT transporter is most likely low, since
	the number of platelet impramine binding sites has not been reliably
	associated with platelet serotonin uptake (Vmax). Significant changes
	of platelet serotonin content in suicidal individuals, as described
	in various studies, are most likely due to washout periods that are
	too short to eliminate the effects of a previous drug intake, or,
	in violent suicide attempters, due to blood loss and dilution. Similar
	methodological shortcomings might account for an often-reported elevated
	number of platelet 5-HT(2) receptor binding sites in suicidal individuals.
	In many studies, the results have not been sufficiently controlled
	for drug effects on platelet 5-HT(2) receptors, and associations
	of platelet 5-HT(2) binding with selective classifications of suicidal
	behavior are often generalized as further evidence for an association
	of platelet 5-HT(2) receptors with 'suicidality'. Finally, changes
	in platelet MAO-B-activity in suicidal patients have not been reproducibly
	found, and the impact of smoking on MAO-B activity has not been controlled
	in any studies.Methodological flaws such as small sample sizes, insufficient
	matching criteria for controls, use of inadequate ligands in binding
	experiments, nonconsideration of comorbidity etc. and considerable
	methodological differences between studies limit their validity and

	and interindividual variability in aggressiveness, impulsivity and
	central nervous system (CNS) serotonergic responsivity. An apparently
	functional 30-bp VNTR in the promoter region of the X-chromosomal
	MAOA gene (MAOA-uVNTR), as well as a dinucleotide repeat in intron
	2 (MAOA-CAn), was genotyped in a community sample of 110 men. All
	participants had completed standard interview and questionnaire measures
	of impulsivity, hostility and lifetime aggression history; in a majority
	of subjects (n=75), central serotonergic activity was also assessed
	by neuropsychopharmacologic challenge (prolactin response to fenfluramine
	hydrochloride). The four repeat variants of the MAOA-uVNTR polymorphism
	were grouped for analysis (alleles '1+ 4' vs. '2+3') based on prior
	evidence of enhanced transcriptional activity in MAOA promoter constructs
	with alleles 2 and 3 (repeats of intermediate length). Men in the
	1/4 allele group scored significantly lower on a composite measure
	of dispositional aggressiveness and impulsivity (P<0.015) and showed
	more pronounced CNS serotonergic responsivity (P<0.02) than men in
	the 2/3 allele group. These associations were also significant on
	comparison of the more prevalent one and three alleles alone (encompassing
	93\% of subjects). Although in linkage disequilibrium with the MAOA-uVNTR
	polymorphism, MAOA-CAn repeat length variation did not vary significantly
	with respect to behavior or fenflluramine challenge in this sample.
	We conclude that the MAOA-uVNTR regulatory polymorphism may contribute,
	in part, to individual differences in both CNS serotonergic responsivity
	and personality traits germane to impulse control and antagonistic
	behavior.},

	in humans has not been established. Thirty MDMA users and 28 controls
	were admitted to a controlled inpatient setting for measurement of
	biologic and behavioral indexes of central 5-HT function. Outcome
	measures obtained after at least 2 weeks of drug abstinence included
	concentrations of monoamine metabolites in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF),
	prolactin responses to L-tryptophan, nociceptive responses to ischemic
	pain, and personality characteristics in which 5-HT has been implicated
	(i.e., impulsivity and aggression). Subjects with a history of MDMA
	exposure had lower levels of CSF 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (the
	major metabolite of 5-HT) than controls (p = .001). Although they
	resembled controls in their prolactin response to L-tryptophan and
	their response to ischemic pain, MDMA users had lower scores on personality
	measures of impulsivity (p = .004) and indirect hostility (p = .009).
	The CSF findings suggest that 5-HT neurotoxicity may be a potential
	complication of MDMA use. Further, differences in personality support
	the view that 5-HT systems are involved in modulating impulsive and
	aggressive personality traits. Additional studies of MDMA-exposed
	individuals are needed to confirm and extend the present findings.
	Such studies could help elucidate the role of 5-HT in normal brain

  abstract = {The serotonergic system is implicated in the regulation of mood and
	cognition. Acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) is an experimental procedure
	for lowering central serotonin levels. Here, the effects of ATD on
	psychomotor processing, declarative memory, working memory, executive
	functions and attention are discussed. The most robust finding is
	that ATD impairs the consolidation of episodic memory for verbal
	information. Semantic memory appears to be unaffected by ATD although
	a limited variety of tasks examined effects in this domain. Similarly,
	evidence suggests ATD does not influence verbal, spatial and affective
	working memory. Most studies investigating effects on executive functions
	have produced non-specific or negative findings. In terms of attention,
	ATD either does not affect or may improve focused attention and ATD
	likely does not impact sustained and divided attention or attentional
	set-shifting. Although ATD is known to affect mood in certain vulnerable
	populations, the effects of ATD on cognition in non-vulnerable participants
	are independent of mood changes. Suggestions for future directions
	and implications for psychiatric illnesses are discussed.},

  abstract = {Current pharmacotherapeutic approaches to the management of violent
	and aggressive behavior rely mostly on agents that act as receptor
	agonists or antagonists at subtypes of brain dopaminergic, GABAergic,
	and serotonergic receptors. Ethological experimental studies in animals
	have shown that drugs may modulate aggression by inhibiting motor
	activity, by distorting aggression-provoking or -inhibiting signals,
	by fragmenting behavioral sequences or temporal patterning, or by
	increasing the rate and intensity of aggressive acts. Evidence from
	animal studies points to large changes in selected brain dopamine,
	serotonin, and GABA systems during and following aggressive and defensive
	behavior. However, the specificity of drugs that are currently used
	to control aggressive behavior through their action as agonists or
	antagonists at subtypes of dopamine, serotonin or GABA receptors
	continues to be of concern. Similar to the effects of widely used
	traditional neuroleptics that nonselectively antagonize dopamine
	receptors, the range of behaviors which is suppressed by either D1
	or D2 receptor antagonists is pervasive. At present, systemic administration
	of dopamine receptor antagonists in animal preparations does not
	target aggression-specific mechanisms. The GABAA/Benzodiazepine/Chloride
	ionophore receptor complex is implicated in the aggression-heightening
	effects of alcohol and benzodiazepines. Although early reports focused
	on the "taming" effects of benzodiazepine anxiolytics, low doses
	may enhance aggression in both animals and humans. Benzodiazepine
	antagonists block heightened aggression after low doses of alcohol
	or benzodiazepines. Agonists at certain 5-HT1 receptor subtypes such
	as eltoprazine are potently effective in reducing aggressive behavior
	of males and females of various animal species under conditions that
	promote charging offensive-type aggression, without adversely affecting
	nonaggressive components of the behavioral repertoire. However, recent
	reports indicate that eltoprazine and related compounds may potentiate
	anxiety reactions in rodents, and question the behavioral specificity
	of these substances. Opioid receptor antagonists modulate primarily
	physiological and behavioral responses of defense and submission.
	Defeated animals show tolerance to opiate analgesia and withdrawal
	responses upon challenge with opioid receptor antagonists. Defensive
	and submissive vocalizations are potently blocked by opioid peptides.
	Substances that target specific receptor subtypes at serotonergic,
	GABAergic and opioidergic synapses are most promising for the selective
	modification of aggressive, defensive and submissive behavior patterns.},

	aspiro[4, 5]decane-7,9-dione methyl sulphonate) shows high affinity
	(pIC50 8.6) and selectivity (greater than 100 fold compared to other
	monoamine and benzodiazepine receptor sites) for the 5-hydroxytryptamine
	(5-HT)1A recognition site; it was both more potent and more selective
	than buspirone in this respect. 2. In rats pretreated with reserpine,
	8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propyl-amino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) induced forepaw
	treading and flat body posture; in the same model, MDL 73005EF and
	buspirone showed minimal agonist activity and at high doses MDL 73005EF
	inhibited responses to 8-OH-DPAT. 3. In rats trained to discriminate
	8-OH-DPAT from saline in a drug discrimination paradigm, both MDL
	73005EF and buspirone generalized dose-dependently and completely
	to the 8-OH-DPAT cue. 4. To define the anxiolytic potential of MDL
	73005EF, it was examined in the elevated plus-maze test and in the
	water-lick conflict test in comparison with diazepam and buspirone.
	In both tests MDL 73005EF induced effects similar to those seen following
	diazepam. Buspirone had similar effects to both MDL 73005EF and diazepam
	in the water-lick conflict test but opposite effects in the elevated
	plus-maze. 8-OH-DPAT also had opposite effects in the elevated plus-maze
	test to MDL 73005EF and diazepam. 5. The anti-conflict effects of
	MDL 73005EF were reversed by low doses of the 5-HT1A receptor agonist,
	8-OH-DPAT; those of buspirone were neither antagonised nor mimicked
	by 8-OH-DPAT. 6. These results suggest that an interaction with 5-HTIA
	receptors is the basis of the anxiolytic-like activity of MDL 73005EF.
	However, its mechanism of action is clearly different from that of
	buspirone, possibly reflecting a greater selectivity for the 5-HTlA
	receptors located presynaptically on central 5- hydroxytryptaminergic
	neurones.},

	responsivity to the 5-HT2C partial agonist, meta-chlorophenylpiperazine
	(m-CPP), are accompanied by similar changes in other endpoints (temperature,
	behavior) is addressed in this brief review of published studies.
	These studies were selected based on the following criteria: (1)
	neuroendocrine (cortisol, prolactin increases) and at least one other
	endpoint (behavior and/or temperature increases) were measured in
	the same populations, and (2) statistically significant changes were
	observed after m-CPP in the healthy volunteer control or pre-long-term-treatment
	subjects. Parenthetically, in the 13 of 14 studies that reported
	both prolactin and cortisol responses, the results were congruent
	for the two neuroendocrine measures in 12 of the 13 (92\%). However,
	neuroendocrine versus behavioral results were in agreement in fewer
	(7 of the 13) studies (54\%). Neuroendocrine vs. temperature results
	were non-concordant in all 4 of the studies which included temperature

	properties. Thus, these neuroendocrine response measures cannot at
	this time be considered a general index of the other response measures,
	nor necessarily an index of the functional status of central serotonergic
	neurotransmission until this is established by more direct experimental

	the actual functional role of the 5-HT system, the more because state

	Pharmacological challenges pinpoint 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(1B) receptors

	emphasizes in particular the role of postsynaptic 5-HT(1B) (hetero)

	5-HT(1A) (auto) receptors, presynaptic 5-HT(1B) (auto) receptors
	and serotonergic transporters, may also have striking influences

	on the association of neuroticism and psychopathology, the ontological
	status of neuroticism, the purport of neuroticism questionnaires,
	and causal issues.The research on which neuroticism is built has
	historically been based solely on the factor analyses of the common
	adjectives used to describe usual behaviours. An abundance of studies
	have shown that neuroticism scores predict life stress, psychological
	distress, emotional disorders, psychotic symptoms, substance abuse,

	symptoms, and health care utilisation. This evidence suggests that
	neuroticism scales index vulnerability to many forms of negative
	affect and psychiatric disorder. However, the associations do not
	clarify the nature of this vulnerability nor the underlying psychobiological
	mechanisms. We present evidence that neuroticism scores reflect a

	of neuroticism with mental health outcomes are basically futile,

	that characteristic and related variables at later points in time.Neuroticism
	is not an explanatory concept in the aetiology of psychopathology,
	since it measures a person's characteristic level of distress over
	a protracted period of time. This situation will not change until
	knowledge becomes available about: (i) the mechanisms that produce
	high neuroticism scores (and, therefore, also psychopathology) and
	(ii) its neurobiological substrate. Only then will we understand
	why neuroticism appears to "predict" the outcomes it predicts.},

	binding in several regions and lifetime aggression. We have replicated
	our post-mortem finding of higher 5-HT(1A) binding in females compared
	to males. We did not detect an age dependent decrease in binding
	in males or females. Lower 5-HT(1A) binding in more aggressive individuals
	is consistent with pharmacological challenge studies. Future studies

	and impulsivity, summarizing the main empirical results of our research
	in progress. In order to assess their eventual correlations, several
	self-report techniques were compared: (a) AQ, used to measure several
	kinds of aggression, anger, and hostility; (b) CAMA, a questionnaire
	already used in a variety of cultures, for measuring attitudes toward
	interpersonal aggression in different instrumental and hostile situations;
	(c) ASQ, an instrument for measuring experienced anger and its expression
	in assertive or aggressive ways; and (d) BIS, used to prove three
	impulsiveness sub-traits: motor, attentional, and non-planning impulsiveness.
	The different definitions of aggression may be grouped according
	to whether the primary goal is distress or harm, focusing primarily
	on the objective infliction of harm, or on the subjective intention
	of harming. Most classifications in the literature show two kinds
	of aggression, even if different names are used: Hostile Aggression
	(among other names it is also known as 'reactive, impulsive, or affective')
	is an act primarily oriented to hurt another individual; and Instrumental
	Aggression (also known as 'proactive, premeditated, or predative')
	is a means or tool for solving problems or for obtaining a variety
	of objectives. As predicted, there was a positive correlation between
	experience and expression of anger. Anger involved physiological
	arousal and prepared for aggression. Anger and impulsiveness were
	also positively correlated with hostile aggression, but not with
	instrumental aggression. In the case of impulsiveness, non-planning
	impulsiveness was positively correlated with some situations related
	to hostile aggression, such as emotional agitation or lack of communication,
	but not with instrumental one. Finally, hostility positively correlated
	with anger and different kinds of aggression, but not its degree
	of justification. In sum, aggression can be reflected in the different
	personality constructs, measured by self-reports.},

	proliferation in response to T cell mitogens, PHA and Con A. Lowering
	tryptophan levels by means of a tryptophan-deficient amino acid mixture,

	a lowering of mood in a subset of male subjects (that had no personal

	a balanced amino acid mixture. Correlational analyses revealed that
	the change of mood (particularly depression and anger) in subjects

	of the tryptophan or 5-HT reductions. However, while fenfluramine
	administration resulted in recovery of tryptophan and 5-HT levels,
	this was not accompanied by recovery of mood. Furthermore, it was
	observed that the lowering of tryptophan levels and the reduced mood
	were not accompanied by variations of the cytokine levels or cell
	proliferation. Evidently, transient and modest alterations of 5-HT
	or mood induced by a tryptophan-free amino acid mixture were insufficient
	to promote variations of immune activity or circulating IL-1 beta

	accumulating over the past three decades. Recent studies on this
	neurotransmitter have extended across the spectrum of psychiatric
	disorder, suggesting a role for 5-HT in psychosis, aggression, eating
	disorders and addiction. However, much of the evidence has come from
	post-mortem examination of the brain or measures of peripheral rather
	than central 5-HT function. The technique of tryptophan depletion
	allows investigation of brain 5-HT function in living subjects by
	examining the behavioural responses to this pharmacological challenge.
	This review considers the current status of tryptophan depletion
	as an experimental technique and discusses the implications of findings
	both in affective disorders and in a range of other psychiatric syndromes.
	MEDLINE and PSYCHLIT searches were completed for the years 1966 to
	November 1996 using the key words 'serotonin', '5-hydroxytryptamine',
	'tryptophan' and 'depletion'. In addition relevant journals were
	hand-searched for the period from 1980 to December 1996. Forty-four
	double-blind studies in humans and three clinical case reports were
	identified; these cover a range of psychiatric disorders including
	mood disorders and psychoses, anxiety and eating disorders and specific
	behaviours such as appetite, aggression and craving. The studies
	reviewed utilized a variety of differing methodologies reducing the
	extent to which results can be generalized. A series of studies in
	depressed patients (before and after treatment with antidepressants)
	and their first-degree relatives have shown the importance of an
	intact 5-HT system in the action of antidepressants and offer new
	insights into the biology of affective disorder. The mood change
	induced by tryptophan depletion may predict those patients likely
	to respond to 5-HT-specific drugs. Rapid tryptophan depletion has
	also been reported to exacerbate both panic and aggression in vulnerable
	individuals. Effects in other disorders are conflicting and further
	research is needed to clarify these findings.},

	The escalated offensive phenotype observed in adolescent cocaine-treated

	by inhibiting 5-HT type 3 receptors, suggesting that these receptors
	might play an important role in the aggression-stimulating effects

	and extended earlier studies investigating the relationship between
	5HT(3) receptor neural signaling and the offensive response patterns

	saline-treated littermates. Adolescent cocaine-treated hamsters and
	saline-treated littermates were tested for offensive aggression after

	methiodide (tropisetron) or the 5-HT(3) agonist 1-(m-chlorophenyl)-biguanide

	levels of offensive responding observed in adolescent cocaine-treated
	animals, whereas treatment with the 5-HT(3) receptor agonist mCPBG
	failed to affect the escalated offensive response. Conversely, tropisetron
	failed to affect very low, baseline levels of aggressive responding
	seen in adolescent saline-treated animals, while 5-HT(3) receptor
	activation via mCPBG triggered highly escalated levels of offensive
	aggression in these animals. Together, these data support a stimulatory

	This article reviews studies of the effects of hoarding on response
	to serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) medications in patients with
	obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), as well as recent studies of
	pharmacotherapy specifically for patients with the compulsive hoarding
	syndrome. Taken together, the results of these studies indicate that
	the "conventional wisdom" that compulsive hoarding does not respond
	well to SRI treatment is wrong. SRIs appear to be as effective for
	compulsive hoarders as for nonhoarding OCD patients. A case is presented
	of a compulsive hoarding patient who responded well to pharmacotherapy
	with a novel agent. Symptom improvement from pharmacotherapy of compulsive
	hoarding appears to be at least as great as that resulting from cognitive-behavioral
	therapy (CBT). However, the combination of pharmacotherapy and CBT
	for compulsive hoarding is likely more effective than either treatment
	alone.},

  abstract = {In this paper we present the neurochemical profile of eltoprazine,
	a drug that specifically inhibits offensive aggression. Eltoprazine
	interacts selectively with serotonin (5-HT) receptor subtypes (Ki-values
	for 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B and 5-HT1C receptors are 40, 52 and 81 nM respectively).
	Affinity for other neurotransmitter receptors is much lower (Ki-values
	greater than 400 nM) than for 5-HT1 receptors. The selective interaction
	with 5-HT1 receptor subtypes is confirmed by in vitro autoradiographic
	studies using radiolabelled eltoprazine. The overall distribution
	of [3H]eltoprazine bears a strong resemblance to the localization
	of 5-HT1 binding sites labelled by [3H]5-HT, although some differences
	are observed. Eltoprazine (1 microM) inhibits the forskolin stimulated
	c-AMP production in hippocampus slices of the rat, indicating an
	agonistic action on the 5-HT1A receptor. The K+ stimulated release
	of 5-HT from rat cortex slices is inhibited by eltoprazine (pD2 =
	7.8). The maximal response, however, was clearly less than that of
	the full agonist 5-HT, indicating partial agonistic activity on the
	5-HT1B receptor (alpha = 0.5). Eltoprazine has a weak antagonistic
	action (IC50 = 7 microM) on the 5-HT1C receptor as revealed by inhibition
	of the 5-HT-induced accumulation of inositol phosphates in the choroid
	plexus of the pig. In vivo, eltoprazine reduces 5-HIAA levels in
	the striatum, without affecting the 5-HT levels. Eltoprazine also
	reduces the 5-HT synthesis rate as shown by 5-HTP accumulation after
	decarboxylase inhibition. These data indicate that eltoprazine acts
	as a 5-HT agonist in vivo in a dose range that affects aggressive
	behaviour (0.3-3 mg/kg p.o.). Taken together from a variety of neurochemical
	studies there is strong evidence both in vitro and in vivo that the
	pharmacological actions of eltoprazine can be attributed to an interaction
	with the 5-HT system, most probably via a (partial) agonistic action
	on 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors.},

	of impulsive aggression and to help account for its connections with

	interactions between serotonin and dopamine systems in the prefrontal
	cortex may be an important mechanism underlying the link between
	impulsive aggression and its comorbid disorders. Specifically, serotonin
	hypofunction may represent a biochemical trait that predisposes individuals

	in an additive fashion to the serotonergic deficit. The current paper
	proposes a modified diathesis-stress model of impulsive aggression
	in which the underlying biological diathesis may be deficient serotonergic
	function in the ventral prefrontal cortex. This underlying disposition
	can be manifested behaviorally as impulsive aggression towards oneself
	and others, and as depression under precipitating life stressors.
	Substance abuse associated with impulsive aggression is understood
	in the context of dopamine dysregulation resulting from serotonergic
	deficiency. Also discussed are future research directions in the
	neurobiology of impulsive aggression and its comorbid disorders.},

	A gene (MAOA-LPR) has previously been shown to be an important predictor
	of antisocial behavior in men. Testosterone analogues are known to
	interact with the MAOA promoter in vitro to influence gene transcription
	as well as in vivo to influence CSF levels of the MAO metabolite
	3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) in human males. We examined
	the possible joint effects of testosterone (measured in CSF) and
	MAOA-LPR genotype on antisocial personality disorder and scores on
	the Brown-Goodwin Aggression scale in 95 unrelated male criminal
	alcoholics and 45 controls. The results confirm that MAOA genotype
	and CSF testosterone interact to predict antisocial behaviors. The
	MAOA/testosterone interaction also predicted low levels of CSF MHPG,
	which tentatively suggests the possibility that the interaction may
	be mediated by a direct effect on gene transcription. If replicated
	these findings offer plausible explanations for previous inconsistencies
	in studies of the relationship between testosterone and male human
	aggression, as well as for how MAOA genotype may influence aggressive

	have been repeatedly reported in bipolar disorders (BD). Useful methods
	to investigate 5-HT responsivity, and the interaction with neuroendocrine
	functioning, are provided by acute 5-HT challenge and depletion paradigms.
	In this review 5-HT challenges are limited to paradigms that stimulate
	5-HT activity in BD.Literature was searched for in electronic libraries:
	MEDLINE and PSYCHLIT, period 1966-2001. Papers describing effects
	of an acute 5-HT challenge on neuroendocrine functioning in BD patients
	were selected.Review of the literature revealed 15 studies: five
	papers described the effects of 5-HT challenges in manic BD patients,
	four papers in euthymic BD and seven in depressed BD patients. The
	reviewed 5-HT challenge paradigms are acute administration of oral
	and intravenous (i.v.) dosage of d,l-fenfluramine, tryptophan, 5-hydroxytryptophan,
	ipsapirone and buspirone. There were no papers which investigated
	neuroendocrine effects of m-chlorophenylpiperazine, clomipramine
	and citalopram in BD patients and were therefore not reviewed.The
	literature on 5-HT challenge procedures in BD shows evidence for
	a blunted prolactin (PRL) in mania and depression as well as a blunted
	cortisol in euthymic BD patients. This suggests that in both mania
	and depression similar changes in the 5-HT system are involved. It
	is speculated that blunting of cortisol responses in euthymic BD
	patients may be a result of chronically altered 5-HT functioning,
	whereas changes in PRL release following 5-HT challenges reflect
	more state-dependent changes in 5-HT activity. The 5-HT responsivity
	in BD patients has also been associated with pharmacological treatment,
	suicidal behaviour, weight loss and age. Recommendations for future
	research are given.},

	deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Furthermore, it was asked
	whether the relation between 5-HT function and behavioural aggression
	in patients is influenced by their age, the intensity of their attention
	problems or their comorbid symptoms.The study employed a double-blind,
	within-subject crossover design. On day 1, 22 male adolescent patients
	with ADHD were subjected to RTD and the subsequent reduction of central
	5-HT levels. On day 2, they received a tryptophan-balanced amino
	acid mixture (BAL), which acted as a placebo. On both days, 4.5 h
	after the intake of the RTD/BAL amino acids, reactive aggressive
	behaviour was provoked using a competitive reaction time game, which
	consisted of both high and low provocation conditions.The number
	of aggressive responses was significantly higher after low provocation
	during acute tryptophan depletion, in comparison to the placebo.
	Furthermore, this study provides evidence that neither age nor the
	intensity of attention symptoms in ADHD patients had an impact on
	the relation between 5-HT and reactive aggression.This study indicates
	that in children with ADHD, there is an inverse relationship between
	5-HT and aggression.},

	and neuropeptide Y (NPY) were lower, while homovanillic acid (HVA)
	was not different in obese women, HIAA, HVA and END correlated negatively
	with the WHR only in abdominally obese women, suggesting a threshold
	effect. HIAA vs HVA as well as CRF vs END correlated strongly in
	the total and both subgroups. An interrelationship between all these
	four substances was found in abdominal but not in gluteo-femoral
	obesity, suggesting a tighter functional coupling in the former group.
	Several correlations were found between CSF substance levels and
	appetite registrations, including END vs voracious eating, and for
	carbohydrate craving vs HIAA and vs HVA (negatively). This was also
	found only in abdominally obese women.Although the concentrations
	of monoamine metabolites and neuropeptides in the CSF sampled at
	the level of the lumber spine might not be representative for those
	at regulatory centers in the brain, the findings suggest that low
	5-HIAA is characteristic of human obesity, and coupled to CRH as
	well as eating abnormalities, particularly in abdominal obesity.
	Since CRH is regulating the balance between the autonomic nervous
	systems, insulin secretion and thermogenesis in animals, corresponding
	anomalies in abdominal obesity in humans may have a central origin.},

	was used to examine the effects of an ethologically relevant stressor,
	namely threat of social defeat, on dopamine concentrations in nucleus
	accumbens, striatum, and prefrontal cortex of freely-moving male
	Long-Evans rats. During the test session, dialysate and video recording
	samples were collected from previously-defeated 'intruder' rats in
	consecutive phases, while (1) in the home cage, (2) when placed in
	the empty, soiled cage of a resident rat which had previously defeated
	them, (3) when exposed to threat of defeat by the resident, and (4)
	when returned to their home cages. Control animals were not defeated;
	in this group of rats video recording and dialysate samples were
	obtained when they were placed into an empty, clean novel cage and
	later returned to their home cage. The results indicated that levels
	of dopamine were elevated to approximately 130\% of baseline in nucleus
	accumbens and prefrontal cortex when rats were placed into either
	the resident or novel cage. In defeated intruders, extracellular
	dopamine levels in accumbens and prefrontal cortex were increased
	further (approximately 160\% of baseline), during social threat;
	these biochemical changes were synchronous with high levels of orienting
	toward the resident but not with heightened motor activity. Extracellular
	dopamine levels in lateral striatum were not affected by either manipulation.
	These results suggest that altered accumbens and cortical extracellular
	dopamine concentrations during social threat are not secondary to
	motor activation but instead reflect increased attention to the provocative
	stimulus or attempts by the intruder to 'cope' with the stimulus.},

	of serotonergic neurons has been implicated as one of the causes
	of endogenous depression. Since serotonergic neurons innervate the
	hypothalamus and these neurons send collaterals to several other
	brain areas, it is possible that hypothalamic sites which control
	hormone secretion receive the same serotonergic afferents that innervate
	other limbic areas in the brain. Several investigators have devised
	neuroendocrine challenge tests measuring the effect of 5-HT agonists
	on plasma cortisol and prolactin in depressed patients. These tests
	help to identify dysfunctional 5-HT neurons, and are a "window into
	the brain." The secretion of cortisol and prolactin is increased
	predominantly by 5-HT1 receptors. However, changes in 5-HT2 receptors
	have also been implicated in depression. Results from our laboratory
	and by others suggest that brain serotonergic neurons stimulate renin
	and vasopressin secretion by activation of 5-HT2 receptors. Therefore,
	the renin and vasopressin response to 5-HT agonists should be included
	in neuroendocrine tests of serotonergic function in affective disorders.
	Since antidepressants produce a decrease in the density of 5-HT2
	receptors, renin and vasopressin could be used to evaluate the antidepressant
	potential of new drugs.},

	abnormal lipid, carbohydrate and low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) monoamine
	metabolite levels in habitually violent alcoholic offenders with
	APD, but it is not clear how these biochemical abnormalities are
	related to each other in this disorder. We aimed to study energy
	substrate metabolism among habitually violent offenders with APD.
	Insulin sensitivity (euglycemic insulin clamp), basal energy expenditure
	(indirect calorimetry), and CSF 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA)
	measurements were performed on 96 habitually violent antisocial male
	alcoholic offenders and on 40 normal male controls. Habitually violent,
	incarcerated offenders with APD had significantly lower non-oxidative
	glucose metabolism, basal glucagon, and free fatty acids when compared
	with normal controls, but glucose oxidation and CSF 5-HIAA did not
	differ markedly between these groups. The effect sizes for lower
	non-oxidative glucose metabolism among incarcerated and non-incarcerated
	APD subjects were 0.73 and 0.51, respectively, when compared with
	controls, indicating that this finding was not explained by incarceration.
	Habitually violent offenders with APD have markedly lower glucagon
	and non-oxidative glucose metabolism when compared with healthy controls,
	and these findings were more strongly associated with habitual violent
	offending than low CSF 5-HIAA levels, a well-established marker for
	impulsive violent behavior. Follow-up studies are needed to confirm
	if abnormal glucose and lipid metabolism can be used to predict violent
	offending over the course of the APD offender's life span.},
