  Abstract                 = {Examined human aggression while under the influence of alcohol and other CNS depressants, CNS stimulants, opiates, and psychedelics-hallucinogens. The PsycINFO database was searched for the years 1974-1992; additionally, to obtain recently published studies, the contents of issues from 9 journals published between January 1991 and May 1993 were reviewed. Results show that CNS depressants facilitate aggression. Neither the pure pharmacological effects of alcohol nor the pure psychological effects of alcohol are important determinants of aggression. It is possible that both effects must occur together in order for alcohol to cause aggression. Care should be exercised in drawing conclusions about the effects of other drugs on aggression because of the small number of observations involved.
