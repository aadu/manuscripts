author,E,"This is an abbreviated format for the author. Last name only if a single author (e.g., ""Bushman""), ampersan with two authors (""Bushman & Cooper"") and et al. if more than 2 authors (e.g., ""Bushman et al."")"
year,F,Year that the report was published.
v,G,"Version number. I generally start with 0.0 and then will increment it to 0.1, 0.2, etc. as I make changes to the coding sheet. If there are two effect sizes (i.e., two rows) from the same meta-analysis then only the first should have a version number -- the remainder of the rows should have an asterisk (i.e., *)"
primary,H,"1 = the meta-analysis was primarily focused on drugs/alcohol and aggression. 0 = the meta-analysis was primarily focused on some other relationship (e.g., ""Risk factors for violence in psychosis"")"

lang,,"Whether or not language bias was addressed in the article. (0 = language bias was not addressed, 1 = authors justified use of only english studies, 2 = language was not restricted to english and/or studies published in multiple languages were included in the meta-analysis)."
,,DESIGN
pool,,"0 = pooling was not obtained, 1 = fixed effects model was obtain for meta-analysis, 2 = random effects model was obtained for meta-analysis, 3 = both random and fixed effects"
hetero,,NR = heterogeneity across studies was not reported; 0 = heterogeneity across studies was not significant; 1 = heterogeneity across studies was significant
quality,,"NR = not reported; 0 = no evaluation of study quality and/or conduction, 1 = simple measure of study quality, 2 = robust or formal (according to a published guideline or checklist) evaluation of study quality."
bias,,"0 = publication bias not assessed, 1 = publication bias assessed informally, 2 = publication bias assessed formally (Egger's regression, funnel plot analysis)"
irr,,"inter-coder reliability. 0 = not reported or not conducted, 1 = reported for a subset of the studies, 2 = reported for all studies."
irr_kappa,,"The actual inter-rate reliability statistic. ""NA"" if inter-rater reliability is not reported. If a range is given, enter average value."
elig,,"Eligability criteria. 0 = not reported, 1 = partially reported, 2 = both inclusion and exclusion criteria reported (e.g., type of studies, measures, populations, time period, experimental design, etc.)"
adult,,"0 = children only, 1 = adults only, 2 = not specified or mixed child/adult samples."
viol,,"0 = non-physical aggression only (anger, hostility, verbal aggression), 1 = physical aggression/violence only, 2 = not specified or mixed physical/non-physical aggression."
agg_method,,"How were multiple effect sizes within studies treated? ""average"" = they were averaged to produce one effect size (includes z-score combinations, shifting-unit approach, etc.)., ""highest"" = they took the largest effect size from each study, ""random"" = they randomly selected an effect size from each study, ""not specified"" = they don't mention how they deal with multiple effect sizes per study, ""no aggregation"" = they don't worry about dependencies between effect sizes and treat them as independent -- (i.e., they don't aggregate across effect sizes within studies)."
weighting,,"How were effect sizes combined in the meta-analysis. ""equal"" = no weighting was used -- each effect size contributed equally to the overall value regardless of variance or sample size, ""size"" = effect sizes were weighted by sample size, ""inverse"" = effect sizes were weighted by the inverse of their variance, ""not specified"" = there is no mention of effect size weighting."
